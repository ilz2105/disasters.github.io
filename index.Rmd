# Final Project

# Motivation
According to the United States Geological Survey, scientists predict that increasing global surface temperatures will increase the frequency of droughts and intensity of storms globally. Recent studies examining sea-level rise patterns and projections (Hauer, 2017; Kulp & Strauss, 2019) have suggested that sea-level rise could induce large-scale migration in the United States away from unprotected coastlines and towards inland areas, redistributing population density across the country. The potential impacts of climate change are far-reaching, ranging from human migration and displacement to increased pressure on inland areas and land disturbance. We are interested in examining if there is an association between indicators of climate change and the frequency of natural disasters in the United States since 1953.

# Related Work
Weirdly enough, the initial inspiration for this work actually came from the coveted p8105 Cow Sticker. The original project idea was going to revolve around cows but our discussions of cows quickly shifted to methane gas and the effects it has on our planet. As a result, we quickly pivoted our project plan to examine climate change and natural disasters. Additionally, our work with NOAA data in class, seeing first hand how in-depth that dataset is, gave us an early understanding of the possibilities achievable with such varied data. 

Climate change has been particularly hot topic of conversation for years, and the temperature has only been rising. Donald Trump pulling out of the climate change agreement was something our group personally discussed at length and our disappointment in the decision played a heavy factor in picking our topic. There are people out there doing fantastic work in the fight for our planet, and we hope to do our part. Greta Thunberg has been in the news for the past few months trying to motivate others to join the cause, and we hope our findings can do just a small part. And maybe get a sticker with a cow on it if we get a little creative along the way.

# Initial Questions
We first want to know if the total count of natural disasters are increasing every five years between 1953-2018 in the United States. We also want to know if average, minimum, and maximum land temperatures are increasing with certain natural disasters over time, examining the states where the frequency of natural disasters does significantly increase with temperature in greater detail. We will fit a multivariable regression model to address our question of whether the United States overall is seeing more natural disasters over time, then create multiple data visualizations to assess state-by-state differences.
