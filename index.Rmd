Scientists across the globe confirm that climate change is at a [global tipping point](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/11/earth-tipping-point/). First introduced 20 years ago by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/)), the tipping point implies a point of no return when changes to climate are irreversible. The potential impacts of climate change are far-reaching, ranging from increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters to human migration and displacement. 


While the recent news from the Trump Administration to pull out of the [Paris Agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/11/04/trump-makes-it-official-us-will-withdraw-paris-climate-accord/) is both discouraging and terrifying, there is still hope moving forward. Through clear visualizations and analyses, we hope to shed light to the relationship between climate change indicators like temperature and frequency of natural disasters. We hope our findings can do just a small part in providing evidence for climate change. And maybe get a [sticker with a cow](secret_cow.html) on it if we get a little creative along the way.

## Dataset
Our team used several publicly available datasets with information on natural disasters, temperature variables, and total precipitation across year and state from 1953-2018. The [Disaster Declarations Summary](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/28318) (Version 2) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) contained summary level data on disaster declarations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) [Climate at a Glance](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/national/mapping/) data included information on monthly maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, and total precipitation.
